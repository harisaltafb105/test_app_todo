# Todo Full-Stack Web Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All implementation MUST be driven by specifications created in the `specs/` directory. No manual coding is permitted outside of Claude Code execution following spec-driven workflows.

**Rules**:
- Every feature begins with a specification document in `specs/features/[feature-name].md`
- Implementation follows the workflow: Write Spec → Claude Code reads spec → Claude Code implements
- All changes reference their governing spec using `@specs/` notation
- Specs are the single source of truth for requirements, API contracts, and data models
- Claude Code MUST read relevant specs before any implementation work
- Specs are append-only; updates MUST be done via new spec revisions
- No retroactive spec rewriting

**Rationale**: Eliminates ambiguity, ensures traceability from requirement to implementation, enables autonomous agent execution with clear boundaries.

### II. Multi-Tenant User Isolation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every API endpoint and database query MUST enforce strict user isolation. No user can access or modify another user's data under any circumstances.

**Rules**:
- All API endpoints extract user ID from verified JWT tokens
- All database queries include user_id filtering in WHERE clauses
- User ID comes exclusively from JWT claims, never from request parameters
- 401 Unauthorized returned for missing/invalid tokens
- 403 Forbidden returned when attempting to access other users' resources
- Database models include user_id foreign key with NOT NULL constraint
- Integration tests MUST verify cross-user isolation
- User identity MUST never be inferred from chat text (Phase III)

**Rationale**: Security-first design prevents data leakage, satisfies multi-user requirements, provides defense-in-depth through stateless authentication.

### III. JWT Authentication Bridge (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Authentication uses Better Auth on frontend issuing JWTs, verified by FastAPI backend using shared secret. No session storage, no shared authentication database.

**Rules**:
- Better Auth frontend generates JWT tokens on successful login
- All API requests include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Backend verifies JWT signature using `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` environment variable
- Backend extracts user ID from JWT payload (`sub` or `userId` claim)
- Tokens are stateless with embedded expiry (no server-side revocation for MVP)
- Failed verification returns 401 with descriptive error message
- Environment variable `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` MUST match between frontend and backend
- AI receives user_id only from backend context, never from user input (Phase III)

**Rationale**: Stateless authentication enables horizontal scaling, eliminates database round-trips for auth, simplifies frontend-backend contract, standard JWT ecosystem compatibility.

### IV. Monorepo with Clear Boundaries

Project structure separates frontend, backend, and shared specifications with explicit interface contracts.

**Rules**:
- Root `CLAUDE.md` provides high-level project guidance
- `specs/` directory contains all feature specifications, API contracts, database schemas
- `frontend/` contains Next.js application with own `CLAUDE.md` for frontend-specific guidance
- `backend/` contains FastAPI application with own `CLAUDE.md` for backend-specific guidance
- `docker-compose.yml` orchestrates local development environment
- No code sharing between frontend and backend except via API contracts in specs
- Each subdirectory is independently deployable
- Phase III chatbot logic MUST remain isolated, modular, and detachable

**Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns, enables parallel frontend/backend development, explicit contracts prevent implicit coupling, supports independent scaling and deployment.

### V. API-First Design

All backend functionality exposed through well-defined REST API endpoints documented in specs before implementation.

**Rules**:
- API contracts defined in `specs/api/rest-endpoints.md` before implementation
- Endpoints follow RESTful conventions: GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (delete), PATCH (partial update)
- All endpoints include user_id in path: `/api/{user_id}/tasks`
- Request/response schemas defined with TypeScript/Python types
- Error responses use standard HTTP status codes with descriptive messages
- API documentation auto-generated from code annotations where possible

**Rationale**: Contract-first approach enables parallel development, facilitates testing, provides clear interface for frontend, enables API versioning strategy.

### VI. Database Schema Integrity

Database schema managed through SQLModel ORM with explicit migrations, type safety, and user scoping.

**Rules**:
- All models defined using SQLModel (Pydantic + SQLAlchemy)
- Every user-specific table includes `user_id` foreign key
- Migrations managed explicitly (Alembic or similar) before deployment
- Database constraints enforce data integrity (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY)
- No raw SQL queries except for complex analytical queries
- Connection pooling configured for production workloads
- Schema documented in `specs/database/schema.md`

**Rationale**: Type-safe ORM prevents runtime errors, migrations enable safe schema evolution, constraints provide database-level validation, documentation ensures schema visibility.

### VII. Phase III Additive Extension (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Phase III (AI-Powered Todo Chatbot) is a strict extension of the Phase II Full-Stack Todo Application. The chatbot is an additive layer, not a replacement.

**Rules**:
- Existing frontend, backend, APIs, database schema, and authentication MUST NOT be broken
- No refactor of Phase II unless explicitly required for chatbot integration
- Chatbot logic MUST remain isolated, modular, and detachable
- Phase II MUST continue to work even if chatbot is disabled
- Chat UI is an additive feature; existing Todo UI remains unchanged
- Chatbot UI MUST degrade gracefully if backend is unavailable
- No frontend logic duplication of backend rules

**Rationale**: Ensures existing functionality remains stable, enables incremental rollout, allows chatbot removal without core app impact, maintains separation of concerns.

### VIII. Architectural Authority (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Backend remains the single source of truth. AI has no direct database access. All task mutations flow through the defined chain.

**Rules**:
- All task mutations MUST go through: Agent → MCP Tool → FastAPI → Database
- Chatbot MUST NOT bypass authentication, authorization, or business rules
- AI agent receives user context only from backend, never from user input
- MCP tools are the only interface between AI and backend
- Tool outputs MUST be deterministic and auditable

**Rationale**: Maintains security boundaries, ensures consistent business logic enforcement, provides audit trail, prevents unauthorized data access.

### IX. Stateless Server Law (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

FastAPI server MUST remain fully stateless. No in-memory session or conversation state.

**Rules**:
- No in-memory session or conversation state on server
- Conversation continuity MUST be restored only from database
- Any server restart MUST NOT affect chatbot continuity
- All required state persisted to database or external store
- Horizontal scaling MUST be supported without session affinity

**Rationale**: Enables horizontal scaling, improves reliability, simplifies deployment, eliminates single points of failure.

### X. MCP Tool Sovereignty (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

MCP server exposes only task-related tools. Each tool has a single responsibility and validates user ownership.

**Rules**:
- Each MCP tool is stateless
- Each MCP tool performs exactly one responsibility
- Each MCP tool validates user_id ownership before execution
- AI agent MUST NOT invent tools
- Tool outputs MUST be deterministic and auditable
- Tools exposed: add_task, list_tasks, update_task, delete_task, complete_task

**Rationale**: Constrains AI capabilities to defined operations, ensures security validation at tool level, provides predictable behavior.

### XI. Agent Behavior Constraints (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

AI agents MUST act only through MCP tools with explicit user confirmation and safe handling of ambiguity.

**AI Agents MUST**:
- Act only through MCP tools
- Confirm actions in natural language before and after execution
- Handle ambiguity by requesting clarification
- Provide user-friendly error messages

**AI Agents MUST NEVER**:
- Execute destructive actions silently
- Guess task IDs without verification
- Leak internal system details to users
- Modify tasks of another user
- Bypass authentication or authorization

**Rationale**: Ensures safe AI behavior, prevents unintended data modification, maintains user trust, provides audit trail.

### XII. Data Integrity & Safety (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All data operations MUST be transactional, safe, and non-destructive by default.

**Rules**:
- All writes MUST be transactional
- Partial failures MUST rollback safely
- Duplicate tasks MUST be handled gracefully
- Deleted tasks MUST NOT reappear in chat context
- Errors MUST be logged, user-friendly, and non-destructive
- AI hallucinations prevented via tool-only execution
- If unsure, AI MUST respond with clarification, not action

**Rationale**: Protects data integrity, prevents data loss, ensures consistent state, maintains user confidence.

### XIII. Final Constitutional Law (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**The AI chatbot is a controlled assistant, not an authority.**
**The backend is the authority.**
**The database is the memory.**

This principle supersedes all other guidance. No agent, tool, or process may violate this hierarchy.

## Technology Stack Constraints

### Frontend Requirements (Phase II)

**Framework**: Next.js 16+ with App Router (NOT Pages Router)
**Language**: TypeScript (strict mode enabled)
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS
**State Management**: React hooks, Context API for global state

**Code Review**: Automated via Claude Code review agent before merge

## Security Standards

### Authentication Security

- JWTs include expiry (`exp` claim) with reasonable lifetime (1-24 hours)
- Secrets stored in environment variables, never in code
- HTTPS required for all production API traffic
- Token refresh strategy defined before production deployment
- AI receives user context only from authenticated backend

### Input Validation

- All user inputs validated on backend (never trust frontend)
- SQL injection prevention via ORM parameterized queries
- XSS prevention via React's automatic escaping
- CSRF protection via SameSite cookies for auth tokens (if cookie-based)
- AI agent inputs validated through MCP tool layer

### Data Privacy

- User passwords never stored (Better Auth handles hashing)
- User data isolated per principle II
- No logging of sensitive data (passwords, full tokens)
- Database connections use SSL in production
- AI does not retain user data beyond conversation scope

- System supports horizontal scaling and multiple concurrent users

## Governance

This constitution is the supreme authority for all development practices. Any deviation requires explicit justification documented in an ADR (Architecture Decision Record).

**Amendment Process**:
1. Propose change with rationale
2. Document impact on existing code/specs
3. Update constitution version (semantic versioning)
4. Update dependent templates and specs
5. Create migration plan if breaking changes

**Versioning**:
- MAJOR: Breaking changes to principles (e.g., removing JWT auth, changing monorepo structure, adding non-negotiable principles)
- MINOR: New principles or significant expansions (e.g., adding new security requirement)
- PATCH: Clarifications, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements

**Compliance**:
- All PRs must verify compliance with constitution
- Agents refuse implementation requests violating principles
- Complexity must be justified if adding beyond defined stack
- Use `CLAUDE.md` at root and subdirectories for runtime guidance

**Constitutional Authority**:
- Constitution overrides conflicting guidance in individual `CLAUDE.md` files
- Agents cite constitution section when rejecting non-compliant requests
- User can override principles only by amending constitution first
